## 好の表达摘录
catapulting herself on board 弹跳
caked with the stuff 沾满了
hop out 跳出
she planted her rear end on the floor 一屁股坐在地板上
This was the beginning of my soon-to-become-acute awareness that the girl cannot take a hint. 这是我即将敏锐地意识到这个女孩无法接受暗示的开始。

she blasted right past me, grabbing my arm and yanking me along. 她从我身边冲过，抓住我的胳膊，把我拉了过来。
I was making this big windmill motion to break away from her, but somehow on the downswing my hand wound up tangling into hers. 我正在做这个大风车的动作，想挣脱她，但不知何故，在下摆时，我的手缠绕在她的身上。

My mom came out of the house and immediately got the world's sappiest look on her face. My mom came out of the house and immediately got the world's sappiest高兴 look on her face.

##  Main idea:
The first chapter mainly describes the subtle relationship between two people. Julie falls in love with the protagonist Bryce. Unfortunately, Bryce believes that Julie's enthusiasm is a troublesome behavior. Bryce's mother did not sympathize with her son because she even wanted him to make friends with Julie. In addition, Bryce's sister has been helping Julie find Bryce, and she has been bullying Bryce. All of this makes his escaping plan difficult. Bryce has his father as a helper.His father doesn't like Juli because she is  domineering and dressed in mud. Even though Bryce avoided Julie through a series of things such as searching for her enemies, they ultimately failed, and even worse, their seats at school were too close.
However, in fifth and sixth grade, their relationship became more delicate .Julie enjoyed spending time with Bryce, especially smelling his hair. Bryce relied heavily on Julie for homework.Although it's painful to be in front of Julie，however, he didn't expect Julie to pass on the answer to him by sniffing his hair, which could be seen as a wonderful 'collaboration'!


## My reflection:
 The author excels in describing characters through action chains, and her portrayal of Bryce and Bryce's inner entanglement is truly amazing! The subtle relationship between the two is very comical, but the author leaves a suspense. Can Bryce get rid of the annoying Julie by entering middle school?
